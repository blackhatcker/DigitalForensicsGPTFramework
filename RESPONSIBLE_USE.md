# Responsible Use Policy

This project is intended to support **lawful, ethical, and defensible** digital forensic workflows (Stages 1–6). It must not be used for wrongdoing, abuse, or surveillance.

## Allowed Uses
- Evidence preservation, analysis, and reporting for:
  - Incident response and security investigations
  - Fraud investigations and compliance matters
  - Litigation support where you have lawful authority
  - Research and training using synthetic or consented data
- Authenticity analysis of media where you have rights/permission to analyze the material.

## Prohibited Uses
You must not use this project to:
- Access, exfiltrate, or analyze data without legal authority or consent.
- Conduct unlawful surveillance or stalking.
- Harass, dox, or intimidate individuals.
- Create, distribute, or operationalize malware, spyware, or credential theft.
- Evade law enforcement or bypass lawful security controls.
- Facilitate fraud, impersonation, or disinformation campaigns.
- Identify or verify the identity of a person from voice/face (“biometric identification”) without a lawful basis and appropriate safeguards.

## Deepfake / Voice Analysis Boundaries
This scaffold may support:
- Pattern detection (e.g., “same voice-over reused across videos”)
- Consistency checks (e.g., audio/video alignment proxies)

It should **not** be used to:
- Claim that a voice “belongs to” a specific individual without qualified, lawful biometric procedures.
- Make definitive identity assertions solely based on AI similarity scores.

## Data Protection & Minimization
If you use this with real-world data:
- Collect only what is necessary for the investigation.
- Redact sensitive data not needed for findings.
- Apply encryption at rest and in transit.
- Follow retention limits and secure deletion policies.
- Log access and enforce least privilege.

## Reporting & Publication
When publishing reports:
- Clearly separate **observations** from **interpretations**.
- Include confidence levels and limitations.
- Avoid sensational claims (e.g., “definitely a deepfake”) without robust evidence.
- Preserve the chain of custody and cite verifiable artifacts.

## Enforcement
If you maintain a public repository:
- You may refuse support, block access, or remove contributions that violate this policy.
- When applicable, report abuse to relevant platforms or authorities.

## Acknowledgement
By using this software, you acknowledge these boundaries and accept responsibility for lawful and ethical use.

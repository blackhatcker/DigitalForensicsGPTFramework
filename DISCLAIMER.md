# Disclaimer (Read Before Use)

## 1) Not Legal Advice
This software and any accompanying documentation are provided for informational and technical purposes only. Nothing in this repository, its reports, or its outputs constitutes **legal advice**. You must consult qualified legal counsel for guidance on legality, admissibility, and jurisdiction-specific requirements.

## 2) Legal Authority Required (Stage 1)
You are responsible for ensuring you have **valid legal authority** before accessing, collecting, processing, or analyzing any data, including but not limited to:
- Warrants or court orders
- Explicit consent
- Organizational policies and delegated authorization
- Other lawful basis applicable in your jurisdiction

Using this software without lawful authority may violate privacy laws, computer misuse laws, contractual terms, or internal policies.

## 3) Evidence Integrity Depends on Proper Procedures
Forensic defensibility depends on **methodology**, not software alone. Evidence integrity and admissibility can be compromised by:
- Collecting evidence without write blockers (where applicable)
- Not creating verified forensic images (bitstream) where required
- Incomplete chain-of-custody logs
- Modifying original evidence or metadata
- Mixing outputs from different tool versions without documentation
- Failure to preserve system state, timestamps, and context

This scaffold provides mechanisms (hashing, manifests, custody logs), but it cannot guarantee your process is sufficient for court or regulatory proceedings.

## 4) AI Output Limitations
This project may use ChatGPT / OpenAI APIs to assist in drafting summaries, RCA narratives, or report language. AI outputs:
- May be incorrect, incomplete, or misleading.
- Must be treated as **assistive** and verified against primary evidence.
- Must not be presented as evidence by themselves.

Only validated artifacts (hash-verified files, logs, deterministic tool outputs, documented methods) should be relied upon for conclusions.

## 5) No Warranty
This software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or non-infringement. You assume all risk for use.

## 6) Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are not liable for damages arising from use or inability to use this software, including loss of data, business interruption, or legal exposure.

## 7) Professional Practice Reminder
Digital forensics frequently requires trained personnel, validated tools, and documented SOPs. Use qualified investigators, maintain an equipment log, and follow recognized forensic standards applicable to your jurisdiction and use case.

# Privacy Policy

## 1) Who We Are
**Project/Service Name:** ForensicGPT Framework
**Operator:** Lyon & Fiurex LLC Group (RedGold Holding S.A de C.V)  
**Contact:** customer.service@lyonnfiurex.com  

This policy describes how the ForensicGPT application processes information when users create cases, upload evidence, run analyses, and generate reports.

## 2) Scope
This policy applies to:
- The ForensicGPT Framework web application and API
- Evidence and metadata stored by the application
- Logs and reports generated by the application
- Optional integrations with third-party services (e.g., OpenAI APIs)

## 3) What Data We Process

### 3.1 User-Provided Data
- Case information (case name, declared legal authority type, investigator identifier)
- Uploaded files (“evidence”), such as:
  - video/audio files (MP4/MOV/etc.)
  - HAR captures
  - HTML exports
  - images
  - documents (PDF, etc.)

### 3.2 System-Generated Data
- Cryptographic hashes (SHA-256, MD5), file sizes, timestamps
- Evidence manifests (IDs, file paths, hashes)
- Chain-of-custody log entries (append-only JSONL)
- Analysis outputs (tool results, extracted metadata)
- Generated reports (Executive/Technical PDFs)
- Incident logs and root-cause analysis outputs (if enabled)

### 3.3 Optional AI-Related Data (If Enabled)
If OpenAI integration is enabled (via `OPENAI_API_KEY`), the system may send **limited** content to an AI model to:
- Draft summaries or narrative language for reports
- Provide operator guidance in the UI chat
- Generate RCA narratives for errors

**Data minimization:** The application should redact obvious tokens and secrets before sending text. Operators should avoid sending sensitive personal data unless necessary and lawful.

## 4) Purpose of Processing
We process data to:
- Preserve and document evidence intake (hashing, manifests)
- Maintain chain-of-custody logs
- Perform forensic analyses and generate findings
- Produce Executive and Technical reports
- Detect and diagnose errors (RCA) to improve reliability
- Support lawful investigations under the operator’s authority

## 5) Legal Basis / Authority
Forensic data processing must be supported by a lawful basis, which may include:
- Warrant/court order
- Explicit consent
- Organizational policy and delegated authorization
- Other lawful basis permitted by applicable law

**You are responsible** for confirming and documenting legal authority before use.

## 6) Data Retention
Default retention should be defined by the operator (you). Common approaches:
- **Case-based retention:** retain for N days after case closure
- **Legal hold:** retain until litigation/investigation concludes
- **Minimal retention:** delete derived artifacts after report delivery

**Recommendation:** define a retention policy and implement:
- scheduled deletion of closed cases
- secure deletion and verification
- audit logging for deletions

- Evidence Retention: [Until Adjudication + 2–10 Years]
Forensic evidence—specifically the original images or bit-stream copies—is typically retained based on the "lifecycle of the case" rather than a fixed calendar date.
Default: Original evidence and forensic images are kept until all legal proceedings, including appeals, are exhausted.
Post-Case: Once a case is adjudicated (closed), standard practice is to retain the data for an additional 2 to 5 years (for civil cases) or up to 10 years/statute of limitations (for criminal cases).
Exception: For high-gravity crimes (e.g., terrorism, crimes against humanity), evidence is often retained indefinitely.

- Logs Retention: [12 Months to 7 Years]
Retention for logs is split between "system/security logs" (pre-incident) and "forensic process logs" (created during the investigation).
Standard Security Logs: 12 months is the international benchmark set by ISO/IEC 27001 and PCI DSS (with at least 3 months being "hot" or immediately accessible).
Regulatory Defaults: In the U.S. and many global financial centers, SOX and HIPAA mandate 7 years and 6 years respectively.
Forensic Tool Logs: Logs generated by forensic software during an acquisition are considered "technical records" under ISO 17025 and usually follow the Reports Retention timeline (below).

- Reports Retention: [3 to 10 Years]
The final forensic report is a formal legal document and is subject to the strictest record-keeping standards for auditability.
ISO/IEC 17025 Default: This is the primary standard for forensic laboratories. It generally requires technical records (reports, notes, and chain of custody) to be kept for a minimum of 3 years, though 10 years is the most common international "best practice" to account for long-term litigation or re-opened cases.
Corporate Default: Most internal corporate investigation policies mirror the 7-year financial record default to align with tax and labor laws.



## 7) Data Storage & Security
Recommended controls:
- Encryption at rest for evidence storage (`/data`)
- TLS in transit
- Strong authentication (SSO + MFA) if deployed beyond localhost
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least privilege file permissions
- Audit logging of access and exports
- Strict request size limits, rate limiting, and WAF controls
- Backups protected with encryption and access controls

## 8) Sharing & Disclosure
We do not sell evidence data.

Data may be shared:
- With authorized investigators/stakeholders under your case authority
- With third-party processors you configure (e.g., OpenAI), when enabled
- With authorities, courts, or regulators when required or permitted by law

## 9) Third-Party Processors (OpenAI)
If enabled, OpenAI may receive text inputs that you submit to the assistant or RCA engine. You should:
- Review OpenAI documentation and contractual terms applicable to your account
- Configure data controls appropriate for your environment
- Avoid uploading unnecessary personal data
- Treat AI outputs as assistive; validate against primary artifacts

## 10) Your Responsibilities
You agree to:
- Obtain lawful authority for evidence collection and analysis
- Avoid uploading data you do not have rights to process
- Protect credentials/API keys and avoid embedding them in client-side code
- Maintain chain-of-custody and evidence integrity procedures
- Follow your organization’s policies and applicable laws

## 11) International Transfers
If you use third-party services, data may be processed in regions outside your country. Define:
- whether you enable third-party processing
- contractual safeguards (DPA/SCCs) if required in your jurisdiction

## 12) Requests & Contact

# Code of Conduct

This project is dedicated to providing a safe, respectful, and professional environment for everyone who participates, including maintainers, contributors, and users.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate in communication
- Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community and users
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Prioritizing safety, legality, and forensic defensibility in contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing)
- Sexualized language or unwanted sexual attention
- Encouraging or enabling illegal activity or abuse
- Submitting “features” intended for surveillance, credential theft, malware, or evasion of lawful controls
- Misrepresenting AI output as verified evidence

## Security & Forensics Sensitivity
Because this project can be used in security and forensic contexts, maintainers may reject contributions that:
- Reduce evidentiary integrity, reproducibility, or auditability
- Introduce risky auto-modifying behaviors (“self-fixing” code) without explicit guardrails and review
- Add capabilities that materially increase misuse potential

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to:
- GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
- Community spaces and communications related to this project
- Any reported off-platform conduct that has a direct impact on project participants

## Enforcement
Maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate corrective action. Actions may include:
- Warning
- Temporary ban from participation
- Permanent ban from participation
- Closing or reverting contributions

Maintainers will strive to act fairly and proportionately.

## Reporting
To report unacceptable behavior or security-sensitive issues:
- If it is a vulnerability, follow `SECURITY.md`.
- Otherwise, contact the maintainers privately at: `conduct@YOURDOMAIN` (replace).

Reports should include:
- What happened (links/screenshots/logs if safe)
- Who was involved
- When/where it occurred
- Any additional context

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant community guidelines, adapted for a security/forensics project.
